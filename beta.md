***College Football Coach*** is constantly being improved based on user feedback. Join the **CFC Beta Program** to test out the latest versions of College Football Coach before they're released on the App Store.

## How to Test

The CFC beta is available via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wF5slOqL).  This version of College Football Coach includes features and improvements that haven't been released on the App Store yet. This is a **beta** release, so there may be bugs or other issues with the app at this time.

**Warning:** At this time, if you upgrade to the CFC beta and *then* downgrade back to the App Store version of CFC, **you will lose all of your data**. This is because beta versions of College Football Coach rely on data values that cannot be read by previous versions of the game.

Upgrading to the beta should not make the app lose your data (that is, it should import without any issues). But that being said, this is a **beta** release so there may be unexpected issues.

## Instructions

- Install the **[TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8)** on your iPhone or iPad.
- Open the TestFlight invitation link on your device: **[https://testflight.apple.com/join/wF5slOqL](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wF5slOqL)**
- Tap the "Start Testing" button.
- In TestFlight, tap the "Accept" button.
- Tap "Install".
- TestFlight may show you an alert that says *"Do you want to replace the current app version with the test version? You may lose the app's data"*. I've tested this, and upgrading from an old version of College Football Coach to the beta of College Football Coach **will not** make you lose all of your data. Confirm that you'd like to install the College Football Coach beta.
